* lib/features/settings/settings_page_controller.dart:
* lib/features/settings/settings_page_state.dart:
* lib/features/settings/settings_page.dart:

   - The state of this card is now controlled by the same controller as the StatisticPage.
* lib/features/statistics/statistic_controller.dart:
   - _incomes and _expenses have been transformed into Map<String, double>, with strDate as the key;
   - _statisticsList has been transformed into Map<String, List<StatisticResult>>, also with strDate as the key;
   - List<String> _strDates contains the list of strDate keys;
   - The strDate getter returns the strDate at _index;
   - The _index attribute holds the index of the selected strDate key;
   - The methods nextMonth() and previousMonth() switch between strDate keys.
* lib/features/statistics/statistics_page.dart:
   - The StatisticsPage class has been modified to use strDate as the index for statistics;
   - The rest of the class has been adapted to use the new attributes from StatisticsController.
