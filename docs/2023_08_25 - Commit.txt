Changes:

 * android/app/build.gradle:
   - Added support for `firebase-analytics`.
   
 * android/app/google-services.json:
   - Updated.
   
 * lib/common/constants/themes/colors/custom_color.g.dart:
   - Added the red color, but it's causing some issues. I should redo the color scheme.
   
 * lib/features/account/account_page.dart:
   - Now, to delete an account, all transactions need to be removed first. Otherwise, the delete will be blocked.
   - A call to `locator.get<BalanceCardController>().requestRedraw()` is now made to redraw the `BalanceCard` when an account is added, modified, or deleted.
   
 * lib/features/home_page/balance_card/balance_card_controller.dart:
   - Added a `requestRedraw()` method to request the redraw of the `BalanceCard`.
   
 * lib/features/home_page/home_page.dart:
   - The `HomePage` is now redrawn only if a local command is requested.
   
 * lib/features/home_page/widgets/cart_popup_menu_buttons.dart:
   - Removed some debugging options from the `HomePage` menu.
   
 * lib/features/home_page_view/home_page_view.dart:
   - Added an `await`, which was apparently missing, and a call to `locator.get<StatisticsController>().requestRedraw()` to the `addTransaction()` method.
   
 * lib/features/statistics/statistic_controller.dart:
   - Added a `redraw` getter and a `requestRedraw()` method to schedule a statistics reconstruction.
   
 * lib/features/statistics/statistics_page.dart:
   - Now, the page remains static and is only redrawn when a transaction is added, edited, or removed.
   - This process is implemented by overriding the `didUpdateWidget` method, which is called every time the page gains or loses focus.
   
 * lib/locator.dart:
   - `TransactionController` is now registered as a `LazySingleton`. This was done to allow better control of the `HomePage` redraw, but it ended up not being used. It's marked for testing and removal if not needed.
   - `StatisticsController` registered as a `LazySingleton` for controlling the `StatisticsPage` redraw.
   
 * lib/services/database/sqflite_helper.dart:
   - `countTransactionsForAccountId` was fixed to properly count transactions for an account.
   
 * lib/services/logger/app_logger.dart:
   - This is under consideration for adding the `logger` package to the project.
