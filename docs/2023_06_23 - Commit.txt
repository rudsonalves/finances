Changes:
In this commit I fixed some bugs and finalized of transaction deletion functionality. See the changes below:
 * README.md:
   - added some project documentation in Portuguese. In the future, I intend to translated the text into English.
 * lib/common/constants/models/categories_icons.dart:
   - added a CategoriesIcons class to control icon names and path. This class store the icon information in a Map<iconName, iconPath> and creates an abstraction to use iconName instead of iconPath in the database.
 * lib/common/constants/themes/app_text_styles.dart:
   - added new text styles and reorganized the styles code by font size.
 * lib/common/functions/base_dismissible_container.dart:
   - created a general function to generate a Container for Dismisseble widget. This Container has a Icon() and Text() widgets aligned according to the alignment argument passed. 
 * lib/features/category/widgets/dismissible_category.dart:
   - background and secondaryBackground attributes of Dismissible, now use baseDismissibleContainer function.
 * lib/features/home_page/balance_card/balance_card.dart:
   - value.toStringAsFixed(2) changed by value.abs().toStringAsFixed(2) in the inner function of the CardBalance clas. This removes the occurrence of "-0.00" in the Expanses view.
 * lib/features/home_page/widgets/transaction_list_tile.dart:
   - added Dismissible widget in TransactionListTile to replace onTab and longOnTap methods in the functions call of delete and edit transactions.
 * lib/locator.dart:
   - added a CategoriesIcons in a registerLazySingleton.
 * lib/main.dart:
   - initialized CategoriesIcons.
 * lib/services/database/sqflite_helper.dart:
   - reorganized the order of drop tables commands to avoid foreign key database errors;
   - the queryAggregateTransactions method now return a 0.0 if the database empty.
