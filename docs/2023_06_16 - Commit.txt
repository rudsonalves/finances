Changes:
CategoryDialogs is now able to add and remove a category, but it still needs to update a category and make some adjustments.

 * add_category_*.dart as renamed do category_*.dart, as well as their classes.

Unfortunately due to the renaming of several files and folders many code changes were shadowed on my github diff, so I won't present them here. I will try to be more careful when renaming files and folders so as not lose the changes.
