Changes:
In this commit, two main changes were made: I the first one, I isolated a balance variable in the BalanceCard class to communicate with the HomePage class and resized the screen if it is true or false. This adjusts the space for viewing the list of transactions on the HomePage screen. In the second, I refactored the code of the category_floating_action_button.dart module, to separating the responsibilities and simplifying its visualization. More details are present below:
 * lib/common/widgets/balance_card.dart:
   - created a attribute balance to register if show balance is on or off;
   - created a method balanceCallBack to communicate with HomePage class the balance status;
   - an internal openBalance variable control the balance in the BalanceCard class;
   - when balance card is change, balanceCallBack method is called to resized screen in the HomePage class;
   - finally, I have added a call to CategoryPage in the vertical menu from BalanceCard.
 * lib/features/home/home_page.dart:
   - added a openBalance variable to control if BalanceCard is open or close;
   - added an adjust from screen space if openBalance is on;
   - passed new openBalance and callback function to the BalanceCard object.
 * lib/features/category/category_page.dart:
   - redesigned the page header to better express the swipe actions on the 
 DismissibleCategory class.
 * lib/features/category/widgets/category_floating_action_button.dart:
  This code was refactored, removed loadIcons, openIconSelectionDialog, and all code from the input category TextField, icon selection and add/cancel buttons. Now this class just manages the CategoryTextField, SelectIconRow and AddCancelButtons classes.
