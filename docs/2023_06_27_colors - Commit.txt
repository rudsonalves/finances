Changes:
In this commit I just adjusted the colors of the application. In summary the changes were:
  * integration of application colors with theme colors;
  * AppColors now takes colors directly from the theme with the functions getColorsGradient and getGrayGradient, to generate gradients with the color palette or in grayscale.
