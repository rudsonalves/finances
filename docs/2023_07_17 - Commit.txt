In this commit I added support for language ant theme selection in the app. For now, the settings are displayed on the profile page, in the future I will create a suitable configuration paga for this.

Language supporte was not provided by easy_localization package as intended. I didn't find advantages in its use compared to use of intl and flutter_localization packages, the flutter standards.

The main changes in this commir were:

   * l10n.yaml:
     - stores the information to auto genetate the language files;
     - added an untranslated-message-file as untranslated_messages.txt, to list pending translations.
   * lib/app.dart:
     - I changed the ValueListenableBuilder widget to use AnimatedBuilder to enable use of the Listenable.merge. This is necessary to listen currentTheme.themeMode$ and currentLanguage.locale$ simultaneously;
     - added locale attribute as currentLanguage.locale to select locale as per currentLanguage object;
     - for theme control replace valueThemeMode with currentTheme.themeMode. The currentTheme class now controls the app's theme.
  * lib/common/current_models/current_language.dart:
    - extended class of LanguageModel for language control in app.
  * lib/common/current_models/current_theme.dart:
   - new class for in-app theme control.
  * lib/common/current_models/current_user.dart:
   - added the applyCurrentUserSettings() method to change apply the settings of the logged in user to the app.
  * lib/common/models/language_model.dart:
    - module created to manage the app's language.
    - supportedLanguages - a constant map with supported languages. the idea is that only this map is changed to support new languages by the app.
    - the LanguageModel class controls the basic language properties and methods in the app.
  * lib/common/models/user_db_model.dart:
    - added userTheme and userLanguage to store the theme and language used by the user.
  * lib/features/sign_in/sign_in_controller.dart:
  * lib/features/splash/splash_controller.dart:
    - apply theme and language settings to the app with CurrentUser.applyCurrentUserSettings().
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb:
  * lib/l10n/app_en_US.arb:
  * lib/l10n/app_es.arb:
  * lib/l10n/app_pt.arb:
  * lib/l10n/app_pt_BR.arb:
    - templates to generate the language files.
  * lib/locator.dart:
    - removed the AppSettings and
    - added CurrentTheme and CurrentLanguage as LazySingleton
  * lib/services/database/sqlflite_helper.dart:
    - added database support for userTheme and userLanguage.
  * pubspec.yaml:
    - added 'generate: true' option to generate language files from *.arb in lib/l10n/.
  * lib/common/validate/sign_validator.dart:
  * lib/common/validate/transaction_validator.dart:
  * lib/common/widgets/add_cancel_buttons.dart:
  * lib/features/home_page/balance_card/balance_card.dart:
  * lib/features/home_page/home_page.dart:
  * lib/features/onboarding/onboarding_page.dart:
  * lib/features/profile/profile_page.dart:
  * lib/features/sign_in/sign_in_page.dart:
  * lib/features/sign_up/sign_up_page.dart:
  * lib/features/splash/splash_page.dart:
  * lib/features/statistics/statistics_page.dart:
  * lib/features/transaction/transaction_page.dart:
  * lib/features/wallet/wallet_page.dart:
    - all these pages and widgets have been set to use internationalization. It is quite possible that some widgets have gone unnoticed in this first change and are pending for a future edition.

I also moved a series of folder modules which generated many changes not commented here, but they are only due to the change of modules directory.
