In this commit I transferred the CategoryPage page to a dialog, as I found this behavior more appropriate. I also fixed the 'More transaction' button so that the ListView would not restart every time a new transaction was read from the database. Finally, I changed and added the internationalizations related to most of the changes made in these last commits. Below is a description of the updates:
 
    * lib/common/constants/themes/app_button_styles.dart:
      - this module sets default color style for application buttons.
    * lib/common/widgets/add_cancel_buttons.dart:
      - Newte module replaced the IconButton widgets with ElevatedButton.icon and applied the AppButtonStyles.primaryButtonColor(context) style to standardize the button's colors.
    * lib/features/category/category_controller.dart:
      - state control has been removed from the getAllCategories method. It is no longer necessary;
      - added an await to _categoryRepository.getCategories(), which now reloads the category list.
    * lib/features/category/category_page.dart:
      - this page should be removed in future releases.
    * lib/features/category/statefull_category_dialog.dart:
      - this module creates a statefull dialog to control the categories, eliminating the CategoryPage angito.
    * lib/features/category/widgets/category_text_form_field.dart:
      - renamed to expressly switch TextField to TextFormField, and support validation.
    * lib/features/category/widgets/dismissible_category.dart:
      - modified to work stateless, as used in other pages. This widget has been turned into a dialog, and it is no longer convenient to handle it with the state control.
    * lib/features/category/widgets/statefull_add_category_dialog.dart:
      - functions cancelCallback and addCallback were moved to the beginning of the code;
      - the statefullAddCategoryDialog function no longer has a return;
      - added a callBack function to the function's attributes to notify parent widgets of being redrawn;
      - the CategoryTextFormField (formerly CategoryTextField) is now built into a form to allow validation;
      - to prevent the dialog from generating a category with a null name, a validation was added to the category name.
    * lib/features/home_page/home_page.dart:
      - HomePage now supports reading old transactions. Loading these transactions does not change the position displayed by the ListView.
    * lib/features/home_page/home_page_controller.dart:
      - getNextTransactions method no longer changes the HomePage state, but notifies listeners to redraw the screen. This was necessary for the ListView to maintain its position after loading older transactions.
    * lib/features/home_page/widgets/cart_popup_menu_buttons.dart:
    * lib/features/transaction/transaction_page.dart:
      - TranslationPage now invokes a dialog for adding/editing categories.
